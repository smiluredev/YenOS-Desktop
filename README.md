**¥enOS Desktop** is a Remaster of Slax Linux, created as a portfolio project for fun and learning.

**Installation Guide (Slax-style):**

- **USB Installation:**
  1. Extract the contents of the ISO to a USB drive formatted as FAT32.  
  2. On Windows, run `boot\bootinst.bat` as administrator.  
  3. On Linux, open a terminal in the USB root and run `boot/bootinst.sh` with root permissions.  
  4. Done! The USB drive is now bootable with ¥enOS.

- **CD/DVD Installation:**
  Burn the `.iso` file using any ISO image burner (e.g., ImgBurn, CDBurnerXP, or Brasero on Linux).
